This project uses a MongoDB to store Data about Air Quality, 
and then a .NetFramework MVC project to get the data from a collection in the Mongo Database, 
which we can then use to make a linechart over the readings of Ozone at a specific location. 

Included is also an earlier project, a .NetCore API, that attempts to do the same.
This project however could only get the data from the Mongo Database, 
as we struggled to find a way to visually represent the data, 
and decided to remake our project in .NetFramework, 
where it was much easier to make a chart over our data. 

Included is also a .txt file that holds the instructions for recreating our database,
but the data itself is not included, so use dummy data if you try to run the project.
